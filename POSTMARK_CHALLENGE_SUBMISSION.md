# InboxInsights: AI-Powered Mood Tracking Through Email Analysis

This is a submission for the [Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators](https://dev.to/challenges/postmark).

_InboxInsights: Transform your emotional well-being through intelligent email-based mood tracking and AI-powered insights._

## üí° What I Built

**InboxInsights** is an **AI-powered mood tracking platform** that revolutionizes personal wellness monitoring by leveraging **Postmark's inbound email parsing capabilities**. Users can track their emotional well-being simply by sending emails describing their day, mood, and activities to a dedicated email address.

The platform uses **n8n workflows** integrated with **Postmark's inbound webhooks** to automatically process incoming emails, extract mood data using **OpenAI's GPT-4**, and store structured insights in a **Supabase PostgreSQL database**. Users can then visualize their mood trends, energy levels, and stress patterns through an interactive **Next.js dashboard**.

Key features include:

- **üìß Email-Based Data Ingestion**: Send mood updates via email using Postmark's inbound parsing
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis**: GPT-4 extracts mood scores, energy levels, stress indicators, and activities
- **üìä Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time mood visualization with charts and trends
- **üõ°Ô∏è Content Moderation**: Automated content filtering with violation detection and blocking
- **üîê Secure Authentication**: User authentication and data privacy with Supabase Auth
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui

## üéØ Use Case

Mental health and emotional well-being tracking is often cumbersome, requiring users to remember to log into apps or fill out forms. **InboxInsights** solves this by meeting users where they already are - their email inbox.

**Target Users:**

- **Individuals** seeking to track their emotional well-being without additional apps
- **Mental health professionals** who want clients to maintain mood journals
- **Wellness enthusiasts** interested in data-driven self-improvement
- **Busy professionals** who prefer email-based workflows over dedicated apps

**Problem Solved:**

- **Friction in mood tracking**: Traditional apps require remembering to log in and fill forms
- **Inconsistent data collection**: Users often forget to track their mood regularly
- **Limited context**: Simple mood ratings lack the rich context that natural language provides
- **Data silos**: Mood data trapped in proprietary apps without export capabilities
